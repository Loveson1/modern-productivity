# Modern Productivity – Ebook Landing Page

Welcome to the **Modern Productivity** landing page.  
This is a clean, responsive, and lightweight HTML/CSS landing page created to present an ebook offer in a modern, elegant format.

## Features

- Fully responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Clean user interface
- Smooth scroll to download section
- "Get the Ebook" button interaction
- Placeholder email input (currently non-functional)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox and Media Queries)

## Important Note

This landing page is front-end only. The email input field is currently not connected to a backend or email service. It serves as a placeholder for future integration.

## How It Works

1. Visitors land on the page and see a brief description of the ebook.
2. They click the “Get the Ebook” button.
3. The page scrolls smoothly to the form section.
4. Users can type in their email (for now, this is a visual form only).
5. The download button leads to the ebook file.
